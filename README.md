PhotoBot was initially a part of the NodeBox Library.

Since 2013 it has been updated to the current Python 2 and Pillow libraries.

This version is usable as a standalone library.

The top layer can be addressed as `canvas.top`. See examples.

`python Kontaktabzug-1.py PATH-TO_IMAGE-FOLDER`

After the first usage there should be a file `imagewell.txt` which can be edited for your image libraries.
