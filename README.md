PhotoBot was initially a part of the NodeBox Library.

Since 2013 it has been updated to the current Python 2 and Pillow libraries.

This version works with Python2, Python3 and NodeBox.



##### Fundamental changes #####
The top layer can be addressed as `canvas.top`. See examples.


##### Installation #####
`python setup.py install`

##### Usage #####

T.B.D. see examples folder.

##### Hints #####

`python Kontaktabzug-1.py PATH-TO_IMAGE-FOLDER`

creates a contact print of a folder. All other examples demonstrate a single function.

After the first usage there should be a file `imagewell.txt` which can be edited for your image folders.
